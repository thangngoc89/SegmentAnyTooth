## ðŸš€ Installation

We use [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) as the dependency manager.

All dependencies are specified in `pyproject.toml`.  
Please prefer using `pyproject.toml` directly to manage the environment.

Example installation:

```bash
pip install uv
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
```

(Optionally) Install development dependencies:

```bash
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml --group dev
```
## Weights download

The weight is released under [SegmentAnyTooth Non-Commercial License](./SegmentAnyTooth_license_agreement.pdf).

To obtain the weight, please sign the agreement form and email the signed version to [hi+segmentanytooth@khoanguyen.me](mailto:hi+segmentanytooth@khoanguyen.me). I will email the link for weight download in working days.

## ðŸš€ Usage Example

After installing the dependencies, you can run predictions:

```python
from segmentanytooth import predict

# Predict tooth masks from an intraoral image
mask = predict(
    image_path="path/to/your/image.png",
    view="upper",            # one of: "upper", "lower", "left", "right", "front"
    weight_dir="./weights",  # path to downloaded model weights
    sam_batch_size=10,       # optional: adjust batch size for faster SAM inference
)

# Save the predicted mask
import cv2
cv2.imwrite("predicted_mask.jpg", mask * 5)  # Scale mask for visualization if needed
```

Notes:
-	Model weights must be placed in the weights/ directory (or specify another directory).
-	Views correspond to different photographic angles of intraoral images.
-	Output mask is a NumPy array with pixel values representing **FDI** tooth numbers.
